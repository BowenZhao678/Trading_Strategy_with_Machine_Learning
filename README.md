# Predicting Profitable Stock-Pair Trades Using Machine Learning

This project develops and evaluates a statistical arbitrage trading strategy using pairs trading, machine learning classification, and econometric tests. The analysis identifies stable long-term stock relationships, measures trading signals, and simulates trade performance under real-market conditions.

## Project Goals

- Identify stock pairs with long-term equilibrium relationships
- Build a trading strategy using econometric tests and machine-learning predictions
- Simulate trades and quantify the profitability and accuracy of the strategy

## Key Findings

- Analyzed over 10 stock pairs and identified multiple statistically stable pairs  
- Machine-learning model achieved approximately 60% classification accuracy for predicting profitable trades  
- Strategy simulation across 200+ trades showed a 67% success rate in top-performing pairs  

## Methods and Tools

- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, statsmodels, matplotlib
- Econometric tests:
  - Engle–Granger cointegration test
  - Augmented Dickey–Fuller stationarity test
- Machine-learning models:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) for trade outcome prediction
- Trading strategy logic:
  - Spread z-score signals
  - Entry/exit rules based on mean reversion
- Simulated trading environment for evaluating performance

## Visualizations Included

- Price and spread charts for each stock pair
- Rolling z-score visualization for trade signals
- Confusion matrix and accuracy metrics for ML model
- Profit curves of simulated trades

## Files Included

- Python notebook (.ipynb) with full analysis and code
- PDF or PPTX with summarized results and visuals
